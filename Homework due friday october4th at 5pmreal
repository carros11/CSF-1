###
### Problem 1
###

print "Problem 1 solution follows:"

import math
math.sqrt(x2-5.86 x+ 8.5408)
 I did not get a chance to see the tutors I have some learning to do, I have not done math like this since sophomoric year of high-school, I looked up a bunch of things online and could not find a very sufficient tutorial to explain it properly.

###
### Problem 2
###
# hw1.py

a = True
b = False
c = True
d = False
e = False
f = True

print "Problem 2 solution follows:"
import hw1_test


print(hw1_test.a)
print(hw1_test.b)
print(hw1_test.c)
print(hw1_test.d)
print(hw1_test.e)
print(hw1_test.f)

%run C:/Users/sam/Documents/GitHub/CSF/hw1print.py
True
False
True
False
False
True

###
### Problem 3
###

print "Problem 3 solution follows:"

import hw1_test


print(hw1_test.a and hw1_test.b or not hw1_test.c and not hw1_test.d or hw1_test.e or hw1_test.f)

%run "c:\users\sam\appdata\local\temp\tmpsvj47l.py"
True

### Reflection

# ...i send about 3 hours looking up tutorials online and looking though my book to try and figure out how do to the first problem non of them really helped me out very much. 
# ... the tutorials linked did not help me on what I didnt understand. 
# … I missed tuesday so I must have missed some important stuff I have I meeting with key tomarrow to go over quadractic equations so hopefully I will be good on monday
